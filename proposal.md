# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: SU2

SU2 is a multiphysics code for fluid dynamics and multiphysics simulation and optimization. SU2 is made for unstructured grids and its fluid dynamics capabilities include RANS, LES, and hybrid models. It was created with the intent of being modular in order to benefit from open source contributions. Other features include goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement and uncertainty quantification.

### Install and run

Check the following boxes when complete or add a note below if you
encountered a problem.

- [Y] I have installed the software
- [N] I have run at least one example

### Notes/concerns/risks

I believe I was able to install the software correctly. When I try and run their automated test python script, I find that the required *.su2 grid files are nowhere to be found in the repository. Unclear where these are stored right now.
